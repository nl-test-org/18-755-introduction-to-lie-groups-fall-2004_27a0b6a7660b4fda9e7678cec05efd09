This course is devoted to the theory of Lie Groups with emphasis on its connections with Differential Geometry. The text for this class is [_Differential Geometry, Lie Groups and Symmetric Spaces_](http://www.ams.org/bookstore?fn=20&arg1=gsmseries&item=GSM-34) by Sigurdur Helgason (American Mathematical Society, 2001).

Much of the course material is based on Chapter I (first half) and Chapter II of the text. The text however develops basic Riemannian Geometry, Complex Manifolds, as well as a detailed theory of Semisimple Lie Groups and Symmetric Spaces.
